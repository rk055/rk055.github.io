I am a PhD Candidate at [CS@VT](https://website.cs.vt.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. My advisor is [Dr. Ali R. Butt](https://people.cs.vt.edu/butta/){:target="\_blank"}. I am affiliated with the Distributed Systems and Storage Lab [(DSSL)](https://dssl.cs.vt.edu/){:target="\_blank"}.

My research spans across two broad categories---**Sys4ML**, i.e., designing better scalable systems (computing and storage) for improving the performance and efficiency of (distributed) ML applications and **ML4Sys**, i.e., leveraging ML or data-driven approaches for improving systems software and resource management.

Currently I am working on the following projects that targets several ML domains---Distributed Deep Learning (DDL), Large Language Models(LLMs), and Federated Learning(FL):

(1) Building novel data sampling, caching policies, and hybrid storage systems for improving training performance of large-scale DDL workloads. 
(2) Developing intelligent procedures for efficient scheduling and resource utilization of DDL/LLM job training/inference.
(3) Constructing novel mechanisms for client scheduling and sampling in privacy-aware high-performing FL workloads.


Before joining CS@VT, I graduated with the highest distinction (Summa Cum Laude) in Computer Engineering from University at Buffalo [SUNY Buffalo](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering.html){:target="\_blank"} in 2019.
