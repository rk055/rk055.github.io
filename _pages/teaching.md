    <h3>Research Experience</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Building bridges between ML workloads and System Resources.</strong>
            <em>Fall 2020 - Present</em><br>
            <span>Ph.D. Thesis Research, Advisor: <a href="https://people.cs.vt.edu/butta/">Dr. Ali R Butt</a></span><br>
            <p>
                Current systems often lead to wastage of resources during running DDL/FL/LLM workloads as those have not been designed to be catered to characteristics specific to these workloads.
                This project aims to design improved systems and algorithms for boosting training/inference performance.

            <strong><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9284294">Container Usage Patterns in HPC Scenarios.</a></strong>
            <em>Fall 2019 - Summer 2020</em><br>
            <span>PhD Research Project, Advisor: <a href="https://people.cs.vt.edu/butta/">Dr. Ali R Butt</a></span><br>
            <p>
                Although the usage of containers has peaked in the recent years, its characteristics when used in HPC scenarios had been left unexplored.
                The goal of this project was to understand those patterns so that bottlenecks could be removed and improved architectures could be designed.

            <strong>Autotuning a High-Performance Datatype Engine.</strong>
            <em>Summer 2021</em><br>
            <span>Intern, <a href="https://www.anl.gov/mcs">Mathematics and Computer Science(MCS) at Argonne National Lab</a></span><br>

            <p>
                Examined current performance with different datatypes in Yaksa Pack/Unpack Library of MPICH, developed scripts to implement optimizations in performance, created benchmarks for providing insights into performance optimization scenarios, and designed an auto-tuner to explore a search space for optimizations.
